<h3>Background</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Secure Assess is a mobile app for keeping users informed about internet security. It was developed for
	Abdul Sultani, Principal Consultant at ConvergeOne.
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Our app will keep users informed about web security issues. Our app is targeted at the average user who
	may not be proficient with computers.

</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Our solution had two parts. One part is providing the user with articles about internet security.
	This will bring to the user's attention issues he or she may not be aware of. 
	The articles are backed by 
	<a href="https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurity">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> 
	and 
	<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center for Internet Security (CIS),</a>
	two industry-standard sources for security. The second part is a web forum where users
	can post questions about security and other users can respond. This will help users share 
	what they know and stay informed.

</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Our project is focused on average users. While the information we present is available in other sources,
	it is often aimed at more advanced users. The average user may not understand jargon used in other sources,
	so we are providing them with an accessible source of information.
</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	For this project, we used Microsoft Visual Studio to implement our React Native app.<br> 
	The project comprises 2158 Lines of Code, 30+ Technical Documents from NIST and CIS 
	read, 35+ Separate Files.<br>
	We used Mocha to test the API calls and used manual testing for the complete app.<br>
</p>

<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	In this project, we learned how to write React Native code, how to use Git and Flying Donut
	for collaboration, and how to use Microsoft Visual Studio. We learned more about internet security
	through CIS and NIST.
